This project presents an AI-based tool for the preliminary diagnosis of dermatological diseases using deep learning and computer vision. The system analyzes skin-lesion images and identifies conditions such as melanoma, eczema, psoriasis, acne, and fungal infections with high accuracy. It uses CNN architectures like ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet along with transfer learning to improve performance on limited medical datasets. Image preprocessing steps—including resizing, normalization, noise removal, and augmentation—ensure consistent and reliable input for the model.
The system also incorporates lesion segmentation using models like U-Net or R-CNN to isolate the affected region, improving classification precision. To make predictions interpretable, Grad-CAM heatmaps highlight the areas that influenced the model’s decision, helping users and clinicians understand the diagnostic reasoning.
Datasets such as ISIC and HAM10000 are used for training and benchmarking. Overall, this AI tool provides an accessible, cost-effective solution for early detection of skin diseases, supporting both patients and healthcare professionals, especially in regions with limited dermatological resources.
